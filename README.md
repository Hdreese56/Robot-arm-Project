# Robot-arm-Project
This will serve as a repositories for harry and Nico's robot arm project


## Planning
We are planning on making a robot leg that kicks a soccer ball into a goal
### Resources
  For this we will utilize Gears, 3D printed and laser cut parts, servos, and buttons
### Scope
I think that our project will definitely challenge us, We have planned out something that will challenge us but wont kill our will to live.
### Schedule
|1/22-1/31| Complete planning and finish setting the milestones in place. |

|2/3-2/7| Create in depth sketch of robot foot and start the leg building in solid works.|

|2/10-2/14| Build A prototype robot leg in solid works and use 4 servos in build.|

|2/17-2/21| Begin coding for the first 2 servos; the hip and the knee and hopefully have them coded|                                        
|2/24-2/28| Code the second two servos, the ankle and the toes.|

|3/2-3/6| Code them to work in unison and kick the ball in the goal.|

|3/9-3/13| Form a Sketch with the robot let and stress test for optimization.|

|3/16-3/20| Analyze the range of motion and optimize it.|

|3/23-3/27| Assemble the parts and wire up the servos.|

|3/30-4/3| Test of unforeseen errors and try and fix them|

|4/6-4/10| One last week of problem solving and to give us a bit of flexibility|
