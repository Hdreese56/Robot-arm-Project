# Robot-arm-Project
This will serve as a repositories for harry and Nico's robot arm project


## Planning
We are going to take a little different route from the traditional robot arm, we will be creating a robot leg. The objective of the leg is to kick a soccer ball into a goal.
### Resources
 We have coded servos in the past so looking back on our old assignments will be helpful. However for the information that is unfamiliar to us, we will use google, classmates, or Dr. Shields. Although our project is difficult we have plenty of resources to assist us.
### Scope
We have chosen a project that is different from others so ours will most likely be more difficult. We need to manage our time wisely and work productively in order to complete the project within our timeframe. We have given ourselves an appopriate time frame so that in the case that we need more time, we have it. 
### Schedule
|1/22-1/31| Complete planning and finish setting the milestones in place.|

|2/3-2/7| Create detailed sketch of robot foot and start the leg building in solid works.|

|2/10-2/14| Build A prototype robot leg in solid works and use 4 servos in build.|

|2/17-2/21| Begin coding for the first 2 servos; the hip and the knee and hopefully have them coded.|                                        

|2/24-2/28| Code the second two servos, the ankle and the toes.|

|3/2-3/6| Code them to work in unison and kick the ball in the goal.|

|3/9-3/13| Form a Sketch with the robot let and stress test for optimization.|

|3/16-3/20| Analyze the range of motion and optimize it.|

|3/23-3/27| Assemble the parts and wire up the servos.|

|3/30-4/3| Test of unforeseen errors and try and fix them|

|4/6-4/10| One last week of problem solving and adding cosmetic features to give us a bit of flexibility.|
